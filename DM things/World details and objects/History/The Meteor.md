A long time ago, after [[content/Characters/The Gods|the old gods]] had fallen asleep, a meteor crashed though the planes before crashing into the material plane, fracturing the land of [[content/Locations/Nor]]. 

Side effects 
The meteor had several side effects, it scattered demiplanes like the one [[Astier Földnélküli]] is from.
It also created the [[content/World details and objects/Plane shards]], their power brough life and magic to the previously barren planet of nor. these shards also created places like the [[content/Locations/Fae Forest]] and [[content/Locations/Geology/Volcanos]].
the main mass of the meteor is sunken at the bottom of the ocean in the center of the mainland. 
its magic created [[content/Locations/Geology/The Spires]] and leaks 'magic radiation' into the world
