Abdal's story
	Abdal was a well known researcher from [[content/Locations/Cities/Beldon]]. She was granted access to the [[content/Locations/Geology/Fae Forest]] and would make trips to document things or trade with people. she visited several different groups in the southern area of the forest. one of these was the [[content/Characters/Skaphos Clan]]. She has been there twice but Astros never really paid attention. Heidi was dating Abdal's for a few years, she didn't want to be seen as "Abdal's partner", and kept their relationship quiet. everyone knew they were together, but it was never a big thing. By Heidi's request their relationship was left vague in books.
	10 years ago Abdal was approached by [[DM things/Characters/NPC/The dark doves]], who said they were interested in meeting a satyr clan in the forest. Abdal didn't take any precautions and agreed. She took them to the Skaphos Clan. When the attack started she tried to help but was cornered by Balo. He told her that there was nothing she could do, and if she interfered they would kill her too. Abdal knew that if she died, the protection she gave to them would be revoked and the forest would intervene. However she chose her own life and stood by as Skaphos clan was wiped out. After taking the dark doves out of the forest she ran home and packed everything she could before running into the smuggler tunnels underneath the city
	Over the next 10 years she grew increasingly paranoid, shutting everyone out, trapping her base, always on the lookout for the next attacker. by the time the "last" remaining member of the Skaphos clan found her she was a mess. That encounter would have always ended in a fight. she was too far gone to consider anything else.
	The part of her that was left was glad, glad that someone survived and could take down the doves, glad that they could get revenge. in some ways glad that they killed her. In death her mind was whole again.
	 Abdal was not evil, but she was a coward, and did nothing during the attack. She chose her life over others, and then did nothing to try and fix the situation. She hid instead of facing responsibility. 
    after that Abdal packed up everything she could grab, and went into hiding in the underlayer of the city. She became paranoid and avoids almost everyone. She still does research in hiding, and has a contact on the surface to get her materials. The contact is
