Over time, when the need arises for new gods to govern aspects of the world, those gods are created though the power of the Old Gods. Each of these gods have no power outside of their domains, however, the definitions of those domains are flexible. To our knowledge, no gods have been formed since the god of the sea, centuries ago.

The Old Gods
	The Old Gods of Time, Knowledge, and Creation, are the most powerful of all gods with many worshipers. However, the three have been asleep since long before they were discovered. Even in their slumber, their power still leaks into the world, seemingly with a mind of its own. Very rarely, someone will earn their favor, and be granted great power. However, many have strived for this power, and only 4 people in recorded history have been granted it. 
	No one has achieved direct contact with these gods, and what happens if they were to wake is unknown. They are called many things but their true names are unknown. 

God of the harvest - Sytherial
	Sytherial is a god worshiped all across the land, they do not have large temples, or elaborate offerings, but their followers are devoted. They are gentle and kind, and easy to contact. they communicate though the wind and the leaves on trees. Their presence is everywhere if you know where to look. They are not a powerful god, and have little influence over the world. They can increase harvests and protect crops from damage. Their main source of power comes from their foresight. Those that pay attention to the signs are given insight into coming events. Infestations can be stopped before they've begun, and wildfires can be directed away from habited areas. 

God of travelers - Nadrin
	The god of travelers is often sought after for short times, and then forgotten as journeys are finished. After some time of this pattern, he no longer grants blessings to all who ask, reserving it for his disciples. Those who devote their lives to Nadrin are granted protection from the dangers of the road. This blessing can be extended, for a short time, to those that travel with the disciples. Many travel to temples of this god to make offerings, and hire the disciples to travel with them. These disciples have no home, but instead travel with those that ask, or often alone.

God of death - Enkin
	The god of death is not cruel, they are cold. They deal death without remorse or bias. He stays detached from mortal affairs except to take those who's time has come. They do not choose who should die, he simply knows when it is time for a life to end. Few have gained their favor, those that have act as either healers or hunters. Their disciples are able to prevent, or promote the deaths of those they choose.

God of protection - Vica
	The god of protection provides aid to most who ask, in exchange for extravagant offerings. Though her domain is protection, her definitions are flexible. For a large offering, and careful wording, she will destroy others in the name of protecting her own. It is dangerous to threaten powerful people without first gaining her favor.

God of the dark - Zeln
	The god of death is the one who takes, but the god of the dark is the one who mourns. They are not the god of the noises in the night, but the comforting darkness of being hidden from the world. For those that deserve it, or have hurt others, the night grows teeth. Zeln can become the terrors of what lurks in the darkness. Fear and paranoia follow those who have wronged them.

God of battle
	Ackterick is a chaotic and bloodthirsty god, always eager to destroy. She is typically kept in check by Vica, unless their duties coincide, and then they make a devastating duo.

God of life - Likon
	Very little is known about the god of life, including their name. All that is known is that they are very powerful, and very old.

God of the seas - Verinalur
	The god of the seas is said to live far past [[content/Locations/Geology/The Edge]], with her power growing further from the mainland. Sailors that venture with the blessing of the sea god, can travel into the dead zone for a ways. She is typically temperamental, and she demands respect.
