Astier grew up in a large demiplane, isolated among the stars. No one knows how the demiplane was created, or how people got there, but it was quiet and peaceful. There were areas of material land where towns, houses, and farmland was built. The gaps between these filled with the astral sea. there were only four clusters large enough to be towns, the rest were individual homes. 
most people theorized that your demiplane was folded in-between the elemental planes due to the amount of genasi born.
Although large for a demiplane, Astier's world was small. Everything was explored, mapped, and understood. There was nothing left to discover or study, except how to leave.
Astier knew a lot about the other planes and wanted to travel to them, after a lot of testing, magic, and help from others, they managed to make a device that would let them travel between planes. Astier set out for the astral plane, from there he could learn more about all the other planes. Plus, the astral plane connects most of the others, it would be easier to travel.
They didnt make it very far. As he was traveling between planes, a process that should have taken less than a second, they were pulled in by something. the only way he could describe it was a hole in existence pulling him in. As he 'fell', they saw flashes of other planes before crashing into the material plane. Its lucky they didnt need to breathe because they were thousands of feet underwater.
getting to the surface, and then to shore. they looked at the devce they created. it was in perfect condition, the runes still glowing. trying to use it again, he saw bits of the feywild in the 'distance' before being pulled back. He began to travel to find more information, but also to enjoy the time they had here. regardless of this being the wrong destination, he could still explore. after a while they heard about the [[content/Locations/Geology/Fae Forest]], a place were the feywild was strong and decided to head there.

The first time you cast detect magic in the material plane you were surprised by a few things
1. there was far less ambient magic in general 
2. every person, animal, living thing had a faint magic aura. its subtle enough that no one native to the plane would notice, seeing it as normal.
