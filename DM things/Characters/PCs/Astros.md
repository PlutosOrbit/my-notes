grew up in the [[content/Locations/Geology/Fae Forest]]

At 9, he disobeyed his parents and wert into the forest to pick flowers on his own. he heard screaming and tried to run back but the normally friendly forest stopped him. he was trapped until the yelling stopped, and then ran back to find his tribe slaughtered. 
His tribe, the [[content/Characters/Skaphos Clan]], was killed by [[content/Characters/NPC/The dark doves]] as an act of revenge for something another satyr tribe had done. they got into the forest with the help of [[content/Characters/NPC/Abdal Stillmoon]].

He was clamed by the [[content/Characters/God of Destruction, Abdun]] as their first follower. they haven't said much to him.

After some time training his powers, he ventured out of the forest and ran into the rest of the party. They joined him in his hunt for Abdal, eventually discovering her underground in [[content/Locations/Cities/Beldon]]. they fought and defeated her.
After defeating Abdal, he discovered that she had been a pawn to the dark doves, and traveled to letta to hunt them down.
With the help of the party he defeated the dark doves. With his life's goal done he broke down and was comforted by Abdun. Abdun explained their origins, and their journey so far. 

Abdun gave Astros a letter they found in the building, showing that another satyr child had survived the initial attack. Astros said goodbye to the party, and left to look for them and recruit more followers.
