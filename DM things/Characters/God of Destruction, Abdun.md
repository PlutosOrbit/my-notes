Ab-Dun

The god of destruction was formed to bring balance to the world. One of the Antient gods was a god of creation [[DM things/Characters/The Gods]]. if left unchecked, creation will lead to total destruction. 
as with most gods __ only has power within their domain, but they have made it their goal to destroy things that have grown to powerful for the good of themselves and others. they seek to make the world a better place.
they are by far the newest god, and have kept a low profile to the point where scholars assume they are a new [[DM things/Characters/Minor Gods and Spirits]]-name tbd. they only have one true follower [[DM things/Characters/PCs/Astros]].
the catalyst of their creation was an attack, innocents were killed, and there would be no one to avenge them. to take down the group that had done this. no one except a single child who survived. __ was born from this attack and the injustice it represented. [[DM things/Characters/Skaphos Clan]]

they are not a moral god. they strive to take down those who are too powerful, even if doing so would cause more harm than good. they are not tolerant

they are the balance to creation, one of the three strongest forces in the world. they are new, and do not resize their power. in order to balance such a powerful force, they too will become powerful.

'I meant to give you a purpose. To avenge those who hurt you; to give you the strength to do that. I didnt mean to destroy you in the process. maybe we cant escape who we are after all.'
