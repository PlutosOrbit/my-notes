A massive connected forest in the northeast of [[DM things/Locations/Countries/Serfa]]. The whole forest is linked and grown by roots connecting to the heart tree. The forest is alive, and is aware of what happens within it, but it is not a thinking creature. It acts more on instinct than anything else.

Fae families living outside the forest make a journey to it when their children turn 6-8. Sometimes they need to make the trip sooner. If parents wait too long, the pull of the forest will cause children to wander off and get lost. All fae know about this as they have made the trip before, but some adoptive parents have lost children due to this. it can be dangerous if not delt with, but after a single visit to the forest it no longer pulls fae in.

The heart tree

The heart tree, or Felonera (fellow-nera), is the source of all the magic in the fae forest it is a massive tree, hundreds of feet wide. it is the central hub of trade and culture in the forest. The heart tree is powered by a large mass of crystals in the center of its trunk. these crystals were part of the Fae wilds, and were broken off, and transported to the material plane. This is the reason fae creatures make their way to the forest, it calls to them, as neither are in their home plane.
