Letta
Culture

Government
	Letta is in the middle of everything, and has lots of influence on all sides. With so many alliances and deals, those deals began to be more connected to the council members, rather than the country as a whole. Even after they were no longer in power, those leaders still retained the deals, and were very prosperous. Over time, their families grew in power and created a rich and powerful noble class. This noble class does not technically run the country, but it does in practice.

	organized religion politics in the worst way, nobility is granted by the state

Pirates
	There are 4 main pirate fleets, they're located in the center and build bases on the spires. Because trade over land is difficult, the easier route is to go though the middle, so that's where the pirates are. 3 of the 4 pirate groups have made deals with various countries to not attack their trade routes, and to keep other fleets away. These deals are surprisingly successful, however they only extend to 1 of the 4 fleets. The 4th fleet seems to have no loyalty, they attack whoever they want, and as they do not have a central base, they are difficult to track. The pirate fleets have no loyalty to eachother, and will quickly betray eachother
