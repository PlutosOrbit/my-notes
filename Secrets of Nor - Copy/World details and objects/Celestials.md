Sky celestials:
	airborn creatures
	they mostly live far into space and are very rare
	there are only a few known skys that have visited [[nor]], one of them being [[Eve]]'s ancestor
	there are two types
	*name*s and nebulars
	nebular are MASSIVE, there are many theories that some, if not all, nebulas are actually these creatures. hence the name 
	*names* are much smaller and live around nor and, possibly other planets, they can take various forms including humanoid  
	not player known: the *names* live around nor because of the magic there. the nebular feed off of the energy of stars but the *names* live off of magic

Sea celestials:
	called abyssals
	they live deep in the ocean and rarely come anywhere near the surface 
	they are very territorial and possessive, but protective
	sky kids creatures/deep sea mermaids/sirens/anglerfish
	want to take [[Eve]] with them because she belongs to them

both types of celestials inhabit the astral sea (check actual dnd astral sea lore)
