The Edge is the dead zone surrounding [[Nor]]
The water slowly turns an ashy gray, the further out you go, the weaker and weaker you become. Some survivors have described the feeling as 'the life draining from your soul.'
The only things that live out here are strange creatures somewhere between plant an animal. more details
For unknown reasons, magical creatures and mages last much longer before succumbing. 

Lore and Cause
	The [[Life Gem]]'s power reaches though the earth, oceans do not carry the power well. In [[Nor]] the land surrounding the oceans provide enough connection for it to be unnoticeable. The vast oceans however, do not carry this power, and the further from land you go, the less the power reaches

Solution
	A large enough magical energy source can provide protection against the void(tbd), however it will run out unless you have a [[Life Gem]], but if you're close enough that it could help, you're already dead.
	In theory, man made land bridges could carry the energy, but that would be very difficult, and no one has tried it
