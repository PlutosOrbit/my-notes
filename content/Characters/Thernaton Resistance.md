<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">My friend, you have met a terrible, terrible demise. But, uh, y'know, I-I don't feel too bad about it. After all, if... if it weren't from me, it would've just been from someone else, y'know? I guess what I'm trying to say is, life... life goes on. W-well, from—for everyone else, life goes on. Not... not for you. You're... you're dead. But that's neither here nor there. </span></font>


<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">It reminds me of one summer day in the park. I was having just a delightful picnic with my good friend Orville. And I said to him, I said, "Orville, I... I have a story." And he said to me, "What's the significance of the story?" And... I said to him, "Orville, not every story has to have significance, y'know? Sometimes, a... y'know, sometimes, a story's just a story. You try to read into every little thing, and find meaning in everything anyone says, you'll just drive yourself crazy.</span></font>


<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">Had a friend do it once. Wasn't pretty. We talked about it for years. And then not only that, but... you'll likely end up believing something you shouldn't believe, thinking something you shouldn't think, o-o-or assuming something you shouldn't assume. </span></font>

##### History

<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">Y'know? Sometimes," I said, </span></font>

<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">"A story is-is just a story, so just be quiet for one second of your life and eat your sandwich, okay?" Of course, it was only then I'd realized I'd made sandwiches, </span></font>

<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">and... poor Orville was having such difficulty eating it! Elephants have those clumsy hands,</span></font>

<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">y'know? Actually, I-I suppose that's the problem. </span></font>


<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">They don't have hands at all, do they? They're f—they're all feet! And I-I couldn't imagine someone asking me to eat a sandwich with my feet. </span></font>


<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">Now, if I recall correctly, there was a bakery nearby. I said to him, "Orville, let me go get you some rye bread." Now, I'm </span></font>

<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">unsure if elephants enjoy rye bread, but I assure you that Orville does. Now, this was on a Tuesday, which was good, because rye bread was always fresh on Tuesday. They made sourdough bread on Monday, and threw it out</span></font>

<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">Wednesday... Or rather, they sold it at a discount for people wanting to feed it to the ducks, and then, prob'ly at the end of the day, finally,</span></font>

<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">they threw it all out. I-I don't recall. I do remember a man who would bring his son to the bakery every Wednesday, and... then go feed the ducks. He would buy all of the sourdough bread. Of course, y'know, you're not supposed to </span></font>


<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">feed the ducks sourdough bread at all. It swells up in their stomach, and then they all die. At, uh, at least... at least, that's what I've heard. Y'know, I-I never saw any </span></font>

<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">ducks die myself, but I did notice a substantial decrease in the duck population over the course of a few years. I just never thought to stop the man and tell him that he was killing the ducks by feeding them sourdough bread!</span></font>

<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">And if you want my opinion on the matter—heh, </span></font>

<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">and I told Orville this as well—if you wanna feed ducks, or birds of any kind, for that matter, it's best to buy seed. I mean, when you think about it, </span></font>

<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">breads of any sort don't occur in nature. They don't grow on trees o-or spring up from the bushes. </span></font>

<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">I don't think birds know what to do with bread. </span></font>

<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">What was I saying? Oh oh, yes yes. </span></font>

<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">So I bought Orville some rye bread. </span></font>

<font color="#000000"><span style="background:#000000">What a fine day it was</span></font>

<span style="background:#000000"><font color="#000000">Nice try, mr hippo time for you</font></span>
