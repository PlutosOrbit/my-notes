##### The Skaphos clan event
______
Eldron had family in [[Serfa]], a band of satyrs from the [[Fae Forest]] raided his village and killed several people in the process. Eldron's brother's family was killed in that raid so he swore to his brother that he would get revenge.

The group got into contact with [[Abdal Stillmoon]], she was a researcher that had been given access to the Fae Forest. The doves told her they were interested in her research and wanted to join an expedition. After being led into the forest, they made their way to the [[Skaphos Clan]]. They knew these were not the same satyrs that had attacked anyone but that wasn't important to them as they just wanted revenge. They massacred the village, Abdal tried to stop them initial, but after being threatened she quickly gave in and led the group out safely.

After defeating the group and exploring their base, the group found a note indicating that another child from the Skaphos clan might have escaped
