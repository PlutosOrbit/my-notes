so when you first got here, you fell straight into the ocean, a nearby pirate ship picked you up. they took care of you for a bit, but didnt really know what to do with you. after a month or two the ship you were on met up with another ship and you were taken over there. on that ship you met a girl a few years older than you with blond hair, freckles and some brightly colored feathers. at that point you only spoke a little common, but as you hung out and played she taught you more common. you lived on the same ship together for a few years before you decided to leave without saying goodbye.
