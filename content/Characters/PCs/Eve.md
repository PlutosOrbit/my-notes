THE ANGELS WANT TO TAKE HER TO THE DEPTHS
HELL YEAH

your mother was never a kind person, not gentle or loving. she loved you in her own way but she did love you. she taught you to be tough and stand up for yourself but if you couldnt handle something she was quick to step in. you only really saw her soft side when you were alone together, and especally when she sang you a lullaby that was passed down for generations. (im working on that rn lol) she died suddenly, most deaths in your line of work were. She was in the thick of a fight when someone got a good hit. suddenly, you were captain. you knew it would happen and you were trained for this. the crew accepted you as they knew this would happen someday as well
she never told you who your father was. whenever you asked she would give you a harsh look and tell you to drop it. none of her crew or closest friends knew either

you always had an affinity for the ocean. you learned to swim almost before walking, and the salt never bothered your eyes if you opened them underwater. when you took over as captain tho, things changed. the water became mesmerizing. staring into it at night, you swear you could almost see lights moving under the water. The magic that could make little waves could now create light, add power to your attacks, and more. the more you used it, the closer you felt to the sea. you were an excellent, if inexperienced, captain. Over time, however, more and more strange occurrences began to happen. storms arose out of nowhere and battered your ship against rocks. earthquakes, not uncommon in the area, happened with more frequency and power. your ship was sturdy and never sank, but the repairs were costly and the damage was building up

one day you noticed an air of tension on the ship. before you knew it you were surrounded. people you called friends holding swords at you. you were outmatched and outnumbered and you knew it. they locked you up and started sailing. much farther from the spires than you ever dared to go, out into the sea east of the mainland. they took you all the way to [[content/Locations/Countries/Orin]] before dumping you on the edge of a forest and sailing into the horizon, leaving you behind.

ABSOLUTELY i would LOVE to go with deep sea angels. love the idea that theres angels in places of void— space and deep sea. the things that exist where there should be nothing. its kinda what faith is, yk? i want her to be forced to accept herself. right now she thinks that if anyone knows her for who she truly is, she’ll never be loved or accepted. i want her to unlearn that. i dont know what caused the mutiny, i dont think she does either! you can have fun with that >:) she definitely wants to find her old crew again. she wants to know why it all happened the ship is The Horizonbringer she is terrified of being found out. of being seen for the fraud that she is. of being powerless. her ideal life is where she’s finally become the person she tells everyone she is: brave, wealthy, and loved
so eve and her mom have a complicated relationship bc. her mom tried to abandon her . eve wants her approval So badly
