The Sakphos Clan was a band of stayers that lived in a fairly isolated part of the [[Fae Forest]]. They were mostly artisans and hunters. they were sometimes visited by other people or groups looking to trade with them, [[Abdal Stillmoon]] was a common visitor as she was researching the forest in that area.


The clan had a tall plank of wood rested against a tree, it was tradition for the children to show off how high they could jump. on their birthday they would dip their hand in paint and see how high they could place their handprint on the board.

##### The Massacre 
The Skaphos Clan was wiped out in a brutal attack 10? years ago. A group called [[The dark doves]] came seeking vengeance against a different satyr band and slaughtered the Skaphos despite their innocence. 

The only survivors of this attack were two children. [[Astros]] had disobeyed his parents to go pick lilies and was not there for the attack. Another unidentified child managed to run from the massacre into the forest. Their fate is unknown.   


The traditional funeral rites involve removing the horns from the dead, then burning the bodies. The ashes are buried with a tree planted above them. The horns are laid at the base of this tree, upright if they were a warrior/hunter, and flat if they were an artisan.

Astros was the only one left to burry his clan. He was far too young to be able to do the proper rites for all the dead so he buried them all together with a single tree above them. He could not imagine them dying as anything other than warriors, even little Solan, so he rested all of their horns upright against the sapling. As the tree grew theses were picked up became entangled in the branches. the center of the village now has a large tree with dozens of satyr horns both large and small scattered thought its branches.
