[[Astros]]' clan

their horns are taken off and placed at the base of the tree (erect if they were a warrior, laying flat if they were an artisan) I think a cool aspect of the cursed tree could be that since they all died violently, Astros could then only see them as dying as warriors, putting up a fight, so the horns grew into the tree, scattered about the branches
His home was a tone of Ewok like homes, barely any ladders since satyrs can jump so damn high

In a way yes. I think the formal way for a satyr to die is by burning the body, then burying the ashes and planting a tree atop itâ€¦but all he could do was put all of them in a pit and plant a singular one (If at all possible the tree could be cursed now)
