Thernaton is a small country sandwiched in-between much more powerful kingdoms

the religion of [[content/Characters/The Gods|The old gods]] was already a major religion in the area so they decided to spread that across the continent 
(describe religion)
[[content/Locations/Countries/Kir]][[content/Locations/Countries/Zin]] civil war
with their new influence they established themselves as a holy land and set up temples everywhere. In order to control their population all magic users must be registered, and magic use is limited
they are pretentious assholes  
the woods outside the cities and town are dangerous (intentional)

##### Experimentation
despite being anti magic, the temples are conducting experiments on magical creatures in secret.

Time

Knowledge

creation
