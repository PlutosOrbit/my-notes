A massive connected forest in the northeast of [[content/Locations/Countries/Serfa]]. The whole forest is linked and grown by roots connecting to the heart tree. The forest is alive, and is aware of what happens within it, but it is not a thinking creature. It acts more on instinct than anything else.

The forest welcomes all fae creatures, including the dangerous ones, this makes the land beautiful, but risky to travel without a guide. 

Fae families living outside the forest make a journey to it when their children turn 6-8. Sometimes they need to make the trip sooner. If parents wait too long, the pull of the forest will cause children to wander off and get lost. All fae know about this as they have made the trip before, but some adoptive parents have lost children due to this. it can be dangerous if not delt with, but after a single visit to the forest it no longer pulls fae in as it has accepted them. 

Most Non-Fae creatures are not allowed in the forest, the trees will close off to them and they will find themselves outside of the tree line. Pushing further usually gets you eaten by the forest. If you are accompanied by a fae the forest will not instantly reject you, if you bear no ill will, it may allow you to pass. Some non-fae has been granted a permit to enter the forest at will to live, study, or trade.

##### The heart tree
__________ 
The heart tree, or Felonera (fellow-nera), is the source of all the magic in the fae forest. It is a massive tree, hundreds of feet wide and is the central hub of trade and culture in the forest. The heart tree is powered by a large mass of crystals in the center of its trunk. These crystals belonged in the Fae Wilds before somehow traveling to the material plane and landing in the center of a forest. This is the reason fae creatures make their way to the forest, it calls to them, as neither the crystal nor the fae are in their home plane.
