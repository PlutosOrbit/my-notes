so, everyone knows that there are 4 main pirate fleets, they're located in the center and build bases on the spires. because trade over land is difficult, the easier route is to go though the middle, so that's where the pirates are
3 of the four pirate groups have made deals with various countries to not attack their trade routes, and to keep other fleets away. these deals are surprisingly successful, however they only extend to 1 of the 4 fleets
the 4th fleet seems to have no loyalty, they attack whoever they want, and as they do not have a central base, they are difficult to track
the pirate fleets have no loyalty to eachother, and will quickly betray eachother

the pirate fleets have their distinctive flags, however, those are just for show, each ship has all 4 flags they can use whenever. they have their own indicators for which fleet they are a part of, but to the outside world, they can appear as any fleet they want
this means that, while most of the world thinks the deals with various fleets are strong, as no fleet has betrayed those deals
the ships just fly a different flag to attack
everyone knows what deals the fleets have, and makes sure not to attack as a ship with an alliance
if things are unclear, they fly the 4th fleets flag just to be safe
The fleets work closely together, obviously there are tensions and fights between them, but they all know that the alliances are the main thing keeping them going. Without the alliances the pirates would be wiped out, they sit in an area between many nations, but despite of that, they make a large profit from this arrangement with eachother


so the fleets don't have specific rulers, or guidelines (haha lol) usually fleets grow though members of a ship branching off to captain a new ship the captains of the fleet ships meet once a year, or if the need arises, to discuss things, mainly alliances with other fleets/countries
captains can run their ship however they want, as long as it doesn't disrupt these alliances, or cause problems for other fleet ships
each fleet has developed a slightly different culture over time [[pirate culture]]

there is a figurehead leader ship of each fleet. they are the "leaders" to the outside world. they are the ones that work with the mainland
they cant do pirate-y things, so they typically have a small permanent crew to keep up appearances, when they are needed for political things, the crew changes to a collection of the most "sensible" looking and sounding members of the fleet

the members of the figurehead ships are generally politically knowledgeable, the captains council decides the alliances and deals they want to make, and the figurehead captains translate that to politics
inside the captains councils the older and more seasoned captains have the most influence, and are kinda the defacto leaders. newer captains have very little influence on these meetings and are generally ignored
generally newer captains are ignored as long as they dont cause problems, so disputes between new ships and captains within the fleet are ignored, but with older ships they are taken seriously
