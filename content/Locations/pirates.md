[[content/Locations/Geology/The Spires|The Spires]] are home to vicious groups of pirates. No fleet of battle ships has been able to wipe them out as they are the only ones that truly know the mapping of the spires. If outgunned, they will vanish into a secret cove or lead a chasing ship into rocks. Attempts have been made to map the area, but the area is dangerous and fake maps are regularly sold by the pirates to keep their hold in the region. 

Three of the pirate guilds will make deals with merchants or governments for a large sum, they will not attack any vessel under that groups flag. for a much larger sum, they will protect those vessels from the other guilds
The fourth guild is unusual, they do not make deals, show no loyalty to anyone, and attack without warning. They never stay in one place for too long, and seem impossible to track. Many legends have been told about this fleet, the most popular is that of ghost ships, but no one knows the true origins of this guild.
