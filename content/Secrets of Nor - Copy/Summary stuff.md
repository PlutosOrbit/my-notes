## Nor

Welcome to the land of Nor.
This world has much to offer, a wide variety of terrains, from deserts, to rainforests, to mountains. 

North
To the north, in the lands of Zin and Kir, the summer months are dry and barren, the high winds cause massive dunes, and frequent sandstorms in this desert region. During the winter, however, heavy snowfalls cover the land. The snow is typically stored as water for the coming dry season, allowing a population to grow in these difficult, barren lands.
Below the desert lies vast plains, broken by sparse forests.

South
The far southern region is covered by a sheet of ice that never melts. Under the ice can be seen trees, long dead and frozen, preserved by the ice. The tops of ancient towers break through the ice, providing some of the only shelter in this frozen wasteland.

East
The east contains a moist, damp rainforest. The nearby mountains direct air currents that push rainclouds over the forest. The mountains and the abundant rivers that snake though this land ensure that the air is damp and heavy. This jungle teems with life, strange plants and animals thrive in the moist earth and air, and strange sounds emerge from the forest at night.

North-east
To the north-east separate from the mainland lies another land mass. This island/continent is bisected by an incredibly tall mountain range known as the Capson Mountains. The southern part of the land is home to a large forest surrounded by plains. The northern part is mostly grassland, however the eastern coast is covered by a dense forest with strange trees that seem almost alive. This is known as the Fae Forest.

Fae Forest
The forest is named such because of its interesting connection to fae creatures and those of fae descent. Any non-fae creatures trying to enter this forest end up missing or dead. However fae people seem drawn to this forest, and can come and go as the please. Many fae live there full time. Fae families living outside the forest make a journey to it when their children turn 6-8. Sometimes they need to make the trip sooner. If parents wait too long, the pull of the forest will cause children to wander off and get lost. All fae know about this as they have made the trip before, but some adoptive parents have lost children due to this. it can be dangerous if not delt with, but after a single visit to the forest it no longer pulls the children in.

Capson Mountains
The Capson mountains reach high into the clouds, their peaks obscured. Attempting to cross these mountains is practically a death wish. They are dangerously steep and the higher regions are brutally cold. The lower parts are full of dangerous creatures.

The Spires
The center of the mainland has a strange area known as The Spires. They are a somewhat circular deep ocean, its depth is strange due to its location. The surrounding land seems to drop into the deep with very little slope, and no shallows. The surrounding ocean behaves similarly, the sea floor drops into this pit. The pressure increases rapidly, and no one has found the bottom. Large spires erupt from the deep and reach far above the surface. The area hums with magical energy and in the center, rocks and even small islands float high in the air. Strange creatures exist as a result of this and people can be changed over time. (think magic radiation).
The spires would be a great trading route, however, the area is occupied by several pirate groups. Trading ships will make deals with one of the five factions to provide protection as they cross.

The Edge
The Edge is the dead zone surrounding Nor. The further out you go, the water slowly turns an ashy gray, the weaker and weaker you become. If you do not return in time, you die. The only things that live out here are strange creatures somewhere between plants and animals. For unknown reasons, magical creatures and mages last much longer before succumbing. 

Underground 
The mainland is riddled with underground tunnels reaching deep into the earth. Venturing too deep is dangerous, and many have died trying. The tunnels closer to the surface are full of useful materials and ore deposits.

## Countries
Thernaton
![[TTaAQqEwt6rPj3KddYiaot.jpg|395]]
Thernaton is a small country sandwiched in-between much more powerful kingdoms. They are the religious center for followers of The Old Gods, they are also seen as the holy land for this religion. They are pretentious assholes but no one can interfere or declare war on them due to their influence. Kirzin tried to declare war on thermalon. that backfired as the religion was popular enough to cause a civil war. The country split apart with Kir being labeled as heretics. 
Magic is seen as wild and powerful so it can only be used by religious leaders who have gone though training to control it. 
(Thernaton has the vibes of Spanish Inquisition and Owl House Belos)

[[Kir]] and [[Zin]]
![[Summary stuff-20240805101147983.webp|392]]
Kir and Zin were initial a large country known as Kirzin. After Thernaton started pushing for more and more influence, Kirzin declared war on them. due to Thernatons status as a religious center, this caused a rift in opinions that lead to a civil war. The country then divided into Kir and Zin, with those in favor of the war banished to Kir and labeled as heretics. 
Kir is still struggling to get the country under control after the split. Any government that forms is weak and dissolves quickly. 
The north of Kir is covered in large sand dunes the size of mountains. many tribes of raiders live among these, somehow creating structures inside the dunes

[[Serfa]]
![[Summary stuff-20240805101204763.webp|355]]
Serfa is located to the northwest of [[Orin]], it is home to the [[Fae Forest]] and near the [[Capson Mountains]]. Serfa mostly wants to be left alone, and due to their distance from the mainland they have been. They have a large export of sheep and wool and stuff

[[Orin]]
Orin on the other side of the Capson mountains. Despite their proximity to Serfa, no conflicts have ever broken out between them. It would be impractical to try and manage land across the impassible mountains, and they have no reason to fight. Orin has a lot of mining due to caves containing precious metals and gems.

[[Letta]]
![[Summary stuff-20240805101247520.webp|472]]
Letta is in the middle of everything, and has lots of influence on all sides. The country is supposed to be run by a council. this council still exists, but with so many alliances and deals with all sides, those deals began to be more connected to the council members, rather than the country as a whole. even after they were no longer in power, those leaders still retained the deals, and were very prosperous. Over time, their families grew in power and created a rich and powerful noble class. These noble families have much more influence than the actual concil. 
Before the borders of countries were settled, Letta was trying to control all the land around the spires, creating a monopoly on trade though that area.

[[Ralon]]
Ralon is mostly rainforest, with a mountain range in the middle. The mountains are home to many monasteries. Due to the dangerous creatures and the thick vegetation, most of the roads and cities are built on or supported by the large trees.

[[Dest]]
Dest is the southern most country. It is cold most of the time, and the culture and economy revolves around fishing. Near the ice wall there are research stations and exploration teams trying to discover what is beyond the ice wall, and why it exists. people have made it over the wall, but it is very dangerous and they don't get very far before turning back or dying. 
## The gods
Over time, when the need arises for new gods to govern aspects of the world, those gods are created through the power of the Old Gods. Each of these gods have no power outside of their domains, however, the definitions of those domains are flexible. To our knowledge, no gods have been formed since the god of the sea, centuries ago.

The Old Gods
The Old Gods of Time, Knowledge, and Creation, are the most powerful of all gods with many worshipers. However, the three have been asleep since long before they were discovered. Even in their slumber, their power still leaks into the world, seemingly with a mind of its own. Very rarely, someone will earn their favor, and be granted great power. However, many have strived for this power, and only 4 people in recorded history have been granted it. 

No one has achieved direct contact with these gods, and what happens if they were to wake is unknown. They are called many things but their true names are unknown. 

God of the harvest - Sytherial
Sytherial is a god worshiped all across the land, they do not have large temples, or elaborate offerings, but their followers are devoted. They are gentle and kind, and easy to contact. They communicate through the wind and the leaves on trees. Their presence is everywhere if you know where to look. They are not a powerful god, and have little influence over the world. They can increase harvests and protect crops from damage. Their main source of power comes from their foresight. Those that pay attention to the signs are given insight into coming events. Infestations can be stopped before they've begun, and wildfires can be directed away from habited areas. 

God of travelers - Nadrin
The god of travelers is often sought after for short times, and then forgotten as journeys are finished. After some time of this pattern, he no longer grants blessings to all who ask, reserving it for his disciples. Those who devote their lives to Nadrin are granted protection from the dangers of the road. This blessing can be extended, for a short time, to those that travel with the disciples. Many travel to temples of this god to make offerings, and hire the disciples to travel with them. These disciples have no home, but instead travel with those that ask, or often alone.

God of death - Enkin
The god of death is not cruel, they are cold. They deal death without remorse or bias. He stays detached from mortal affairs except to take those whose time has come. They do not choose who should die, he simply knows when it is time for a life to end. Few have gained their favor, those that have act as either healers or hunters. Their disciples are able to prevent, or promote the deaths of those they choose.
(think Thanatos)

God of protection - Vica
The god of protection provides aid to most who ask, in exchange for extravagant offerings. Though her domain is protection, her definitions are flexible. For a large offering, and careful wording, she will destroy others in the name of protecting her own. It is dangerous to threaten powerful people without first gaining her favor.

God of the dark - Zeln
The god of death is the one who takes, but the god of the dark is the one who mourns. They are not the god of the noises in the night, but the comforting darkness of being hidden from the world. For those that deserve it, or have hurt others, the night grows teeth. Zeln can become the terrors of what lurks in the darkness. Fear and paranoia follow those who have wronged them.

God of War - Ackterick
Ackterick is a chaotic and bloodthirsty god, always eager to destroy. She is typically kept in check by Vica, unless their duties coincide, and then they make a devastating duo.

God of life - Unknown
Very little is known about the god of life, including their name. All that is known is that they are very powerful, and very old.

God of the seas - Verinalur
The god of the seas is said to live far past The Edge, with her power growing further from the mainland. Sailors that venture with the blessing of the sea god, can travel into the dead zone for a ways. She is typically temperamental, and she demands respect.

Here is the stuff you specifically would know

Thernaton's rise to power was because of their religion, but it did not occur naturally. It was a calculated move to gain influence and survive as a small country. (this is suspected by many outside of the country)
Thernaton's restrictions on magic are a way of controlling people (duh) but they do not view magic to be as sacred as they say. The temples they have are not just for worship, but for magical experimentation. Your organization has seen creatures from the spires being smuggled in and never seen again. The areas outside of towns are very dangerous at night, with monsters that should not exist roaming the hills. The government is planning something. About 10 years ago they started pushing their influence more than usual, and have been making deals and having meetings with a wide variety of people. they are putting together and sending out exploration teams to who knows where. They are planning something and its probably bad. 


This world is divided into two continents. The mainland and the (name TBD) to the east.

The mainland has 5 countries
- Dest
- Thernaton
- Ralon
- Kir
- and Zin

the island has two
- Serfa
- and Orin
