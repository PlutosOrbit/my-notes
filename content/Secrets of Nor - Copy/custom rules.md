Travel 
	normal - half speed - normal stealth check
	pass without a trace - full speed - normal stealth check
	pass without a trace - half speed - stealth check +10
	perception checks can be made by 2 people or 1 with advantage
	point position will be more likely to see danger ahead 
	rear position will be more likely to spot missed details or people following the group

Flanking
    2 people directly opposite an enemy have a +2 to attacks

Ranged
    only have disadvantage against close targets

  half/3 quarter cover
      applies to ALL attacks and saving throws if the cover is between you and the attacker/center of AOE
      duck behind cover can be a reaction if there is reasonable cover within 5 feet (this CAN trigger opportunity attacks)

Flexible stats and proficiencies
    ex. Strength based charisma
    ex. rolling int with proficiency if it makes sense  

unconscious
    if you drop down to exactly 0 hit points, you are unconscious, but you dont have to make death saves
    no unconscious crits 
    going unconscious and coming back up gives you a level of exhaustion (no yoyo-ing)

Health
    you can give someone a potion as an action, or take it yourself as a bonus action
    if you take your full action to drink it you get max health from it

guidance
    checks over time don't get guidance
    people WILL notice unless you make a stealth or performance to hide it. if youre talking to someone and cast a spell they will find it super suspicious. 
    if you dont know someone is making a check you cant give guidance  

Cats have Darkvision (its dumb that they dont)
