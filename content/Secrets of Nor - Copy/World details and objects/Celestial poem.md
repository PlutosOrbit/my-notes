There once was a person who yearned for the sky 
They belonged to the earth with their feet on the ground 
At the tallest peak they found someone in the sky

They danced in the wind and belonged to the sky 
but never could touch the ground
The earth burned their feet and the grass was too sharp 
So they simply observed from afar

The two became close on that mountain peak
one day a child was born
A child of earth and sky

He could run though the grass and soar though the sky 
The best of both worlds some might say
The earth made him dizzy but he couldn't stay in the sky. 
Oh what a shame to be part of two worlds, but never accepted by one

He travelled far to find somewhere to call his own
rejected by earth and sky, he made his way to the sea
On the dark stormy waves he found his home

We belong to the earth now
With a touch of the sky
But we sail on the seas
to spite the very things that we are 


____
Deep underwater belong creatures of sea
One swam to the sky during the dark ocean nights
He found a person sailing the seas
A place where she didnt belong

The two became close on those dark ocean nights
one day a child was born
A child of earth, sky and sea

The sea calls its own, pulling deeper and deeper
until the earth and sky are gone
you belong to the sea, and it will find you
i can only keep you safe for so long
