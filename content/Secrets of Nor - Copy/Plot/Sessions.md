    eldron speech
    _________
    	You! when i heard a satyr killed abdal i knew you would come here. You want to kill us for what we did? we were in the right! We were protecting our people! satyrs killed my family, and our revenge was justified.
    	astros probably mentions it wasnt his clan
    	It doesnt matter! your kind killed my family, so i killed yours, this is just how the world works.<br> 
    find a letter.
    	--eldron-- 
    	Abdals been killed. some group with a satyr came though and got to her. not sure how but they got past the traps, but they must be clever. 
    	I expect a final payment for this.
    	--balo--<br> 
    pile of 50 gold with
    	--balo--
    	good job with the warning. we'll be waiting for them. 
    	That must be the kid that ran into the forest during the fight. I assumed it died out there but i guess not. Now we can really wrap all of this up for good.
    	heres the payment enclosed.
    	--eldron--<br> 
    talk with [[God of Destruction, Abdun]]
    	we're here to balance the world, to keep things from spiraling out of control. we can only act inside our domains. unable to affect anything else
    	most of us can control both sides of the coin. Sytherial can create a bountiful harvest or blight the crops. Vica can give or take away protection. those who only control one side of things have a pairing. Likon and Enkin, life and death. I do not. *grabs a leaf that crumbles in their hand* i am destruction without creation
    	do you know how gods are made?
    	when the world starts to fall out of balance we begin to form, we are a thought, an idea, that gains more awareness over time. but for all of us there is a single moment where we come into being. a catalyst. we go from a concept, to a being. All the books you will read say that Verinalur is the newest god, but they are wrong. I am. I have not been recorded, my name is not known. the other gods are not truly aware of my existence
    	do you know what my catalyst was?
    	a massacre, destruction without reason or cause and with nothing to prevent it. and a young child who wished with all his heart to destroy the ones who did this. i watched, newly formed, as this child struggled to give his people the proper rights and burials. i made that child my first follower, my only follower for a while. 
    	*turns to astros* I...i wanted to give you aa purpose, something to hold on to and strive for. a reason to keep going. but i didnt mean to destroy you in the process. i guess we truly cant escape our nature.
    	i have taken some time and gathered a few more followers. i have explored the world and i know my purpose now. there are people with too much power, governments that tower above others and seem untouchable. they need to be taken down. but you do not have to follow me. there is something you should see.
    	i found this after the fight. *hands over letters*
    	the choice is yours. you can continue with your group, take down those who need it, or try to find your family. i dont know if this person is alive. no matter what you choose, i will be with you.
    	i should tell you my name. its Abdun
