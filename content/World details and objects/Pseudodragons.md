Pseudodragons come in a wide variety of sizes and behaviors. The largest can be the size of a medium dog, while the smallest are sparrow sized. The larger kinds tend to live in mountain or desert areas, where as nearly all of the smaller types are found in the [[content/Locations/Countries/Ralon|Ralon]] jungle region.

Pseudodragon swarms
	The smallest pseudodragons live, and travel, in swarms. These swarms can be anywhere from 20 to several hundred dragons large. They typically eat vegetation and use their blazing hot fire breath to defend themselves. Swarm dragons are typically aggressive and destructive. Disturbing a nest of them is dangerous at best.
	Although they typically stay within the rainforest, some swarms have been reported outside on the surrounding plains. With scarcer vegetation these swarms will quickly consume all plant life in the area, and if not delt with quickly, will continue to devour  until they find their way back to the rainforest. 
	Dealing with swarms outside of the forest is extremally dangerous as, even in their small size, these pseudodragons retain their fire breath. Without the damp air of the rainforest, wildfires can start quickly. Specialists are typically called in to heard the dragons back to the forest without agitating them.

Chamaeleon Pseudodragon
	Chamaeleon pseudodragons are named for their ability to hide ( yeah no shit). One type is able to change its scales to match the environment around it.
	the other kind typically life's in forest, and its coloring and presentation changed based on the seasons, typically mimicking the leaves or branches of trees. both of these types are typically solitary creatures
